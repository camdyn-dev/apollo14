      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>First off, thanks for checking out my page. It was quite a blast to build.</p>
      <p>I'm a Full-Stack developer with previous experience and certifications in Information Security, most notably
        CompTIA's A+, Network+ and Security+, alongside being an Associate of (ISC)2.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm well versed in base Javascript, Node & Express.js, MongoDB and HTML/CSS, while using Git/GitHub for version
        control. My current stack is that, as I am in the process of picking up React.
        <br>
        <br>My current
        stack is Mongo, Express and Node.js, using Git/Github for version control.

      <h2>Projects - Main</h2>
      <p>The source code for these projects are viewable at my <a href="https://github.com/camdyn-dev">GitHub</a>.
      </p>
      <p><a>This website!</a></p>
      <p>This is currently meant to be a portfolio website, but it was so fun to build I might be
        making
        more of them and migrating! It's constructed using Three.Js and CSS Grid.</p>
      <p><a href="https://camdyn-shopstop.herokuapp.com/shop/main">ShopStop: A full-stack, CRUD e-commerce site</a></p>
      <p>I created ShopStop over a few weeks using Mongo, Express and Node.js. It uses Paypal to handle payments (as
        I
        didn't know Stripe at the time).
        <br>
        The CRUD parts include the review system that requires a confirmed account, as well as my back-end management
        system that lets me create, edit and delete item postings!
      </p>
      <h3>Misc</h3>
      <p><a href="https://camdyn-dev.github.io/projectAPI/">projectAPI - A basic API that returns a project idea upon
          request</a></p>
      <p>
        Originally, I planned on fleshing it out quite a bit, but decided to put it on the backburner as I wasn't sure
        what the best route was to add projects, alongside more interesting ideas coming up.
