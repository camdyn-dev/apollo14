      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>First off, thanks for checking out my page. It was a blast to build.</p>
      <p>I'm a Full-Stack developer with previous experience and certifications in Information Security, most notably
        CompTIA's Security+ alongside being an Associate of (ISC)2.
        <br>
        <br>
        Javascript is currently my strongest language, but I'm more than competent in Python and other languages. Currently I know Javascript, Python, SQL
        and some C alongside a bunch of various tools, but I'm working towards expanding my skillset as much as possible (maybe by picking up Java).
        <br>

      <h2>Projects - Main</h2>
      <p>The source code for these projects are viewable at my <a href="https://github.com/camdyn-dev">GitHub</a>.
      </p>
      <p><a>This website!</a></p>
      <p>This is currently meant to be a portfolio website, but it was so fun to build I might be
        making
        more of them and migrating. It's constructed using Three.Js.</p>
      <p><a href="https://clickstop.herokuapp.com">ClickStop - E-commerce web app</a></p>
      <p>I created ClickStop over a few weeks using Mongo, Express and Node.js. It uses Paypal to handle payments (as
        I
        didn't know Stripe at the time).
        <br>
        The CRUD parts include the review system that requires a confirmed account, as well as my back-end management
        system that lets me create, edit and delete item postings.
      </p>
